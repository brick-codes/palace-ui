UI for Palace card game (currently only web). For the backend, see [palace-server](https://github.com/brick-codes/palace-server/).

[Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shithead_(card_game)) is known by many other names (some of which are rather crude), and many variations of the basic rules exist. Our version of Palace is just one of these variations.
